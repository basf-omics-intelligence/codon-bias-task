# Task: Analysis of synonymous codon usage biases in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, in relation to gene expression

## Instructions

Please perform your analysis in the jupyter notebook [analyse_codon_bias.ipynb](analyse_codon_bias.ipynb). 
There is code to download and preprocess the data to perform the analysis.

Please clone this repository locally, do your analysis, and push back your edits to this same repository. 
We would like to have the final version 3 days before the day of the plenary interview (your presentation about background,
